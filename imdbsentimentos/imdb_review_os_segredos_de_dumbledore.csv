Calicodreamin,"No surprise that the visuals were breathtaking, some beautiful shots and immersive cinematography. However, there was no depth to the plot. Some lovely character moments.","Visually stunning, lacked depth"
loukan-16780,"No Johnny Depp no Fantastic Beasts 3 movie. I'm so disappointed at Warner Bros. Although I love Mads Mikkelsen I don't like when the cast is changed. It's sad because I have looking forward to see this movie. I just watched 1 and 2 and was so looking forward to see 3 but like I said, no Jonny Depp no Fantastic Beasts.",No!
trash-mailnervmichnicht,A movie with some solid ideas for character development and a promising overall plotline that constantly loses itself in meaningless subplots and ridicoulus moments of mere fan service. Overall the movie ended up being a visually impressive gathering of missed opportunities.,A gathering of missed opportunities
Ruben17,"Was the third installment in the Fantastic Beast ""universe"" a succes?",The lack of intensity in the action scenes made this movie rather forgettable than rewatchable
yocar-97431,"It is nothing short of magical... as to how they pulled this rubbish off. Pretty bad only augmented by the fact that this series is over. (Wand salute!) No more having to watch Nut or Newt. And I guess Johnny Depp couldn't make it again. So, just believe it really isn't Mads, it's magic. And, you're not very magical if you don't see it. Maybe the spell will lift now, but don't see how really is.",How disenchanting
aalokpattnaik,"No story, too slow. Harry potter series was famous for its storyline, they could able to cover a big book in 2hr movie. Now in this fantastic beast series in last 3 movies combined they havent shown 1/10th what a single harry potter movie used to be. Its like 2 page of script and they are making movie.",Its a dumb movie
TharsheyN,"No Johnny Depp, he is basically the embodiment of Gellart Grindelwald and with him gone the character is just not the same. I haven't watched the film and I refuse to do so but from the trailers and what friends and family have told me I can already tell the film is a distaster. From it becoming a politically charged mess to Dumbledore apparently being gay now? Because wider audience appeal and then the nail in the coffin of recasting Grindelwald.",Fantastic Beasts Is Ruined!
Janju76,I don't understand what the idea of this movie was. It has a lot of nonsense fit together into a movie that doesn't matter at all. The whole idea of the movie makes no sense.,Confusing nonsense.
mrs-moo-dude,Just when I thought it couldn't get any more insulting than The Crimes of Grindelwald - Yates & Rowling outdid themselves in spectacular fashion.,Send this franchise to Azkaban
wheatley-20230,"I probably managed to stay awake for less than half of this film, if you add up the bits that I endured. Perhaps that means I don't have the right to judge it. But to my mind it accurately reflects the fare on offer. A lot of the dialogue was inaudible. Nothing much happened for long periods. When action does kick in it can be visually stirring, but with so little investment in the characters and their predicament it was not exciting.",Fell Asleep
samirk-84718,Wow. I can honestly say that I will never watch this movie ever again or recommend it to anyone. It was awful from beginning to end. I have always been a fan of Mads Mikkelsen but he was TERRIBLE as Grindewald. Absolutely horrendous movie.,Waste of time effort and money
jakethesnake-42007,"Fantastic beasts was always a good idea on paper but it turned out meh and now it's officially dead in the water. It would be interesting to see if they make another after the poor box office results and mixed reactions. I found the first movie ok not great not good but ok , the second was meh and now it's also meh but it's the worst of the series. Like the first 2 the length time is a main falter. The story is not much its most of a waste of a movie. I hope the series stops I love Harry Potter but it's just a cash grab now.",The franchise needs to stop
pouya-sanaei,"Well what do you expect here, 0 story, nothing makes actual sense. Just pure cash grab tend to waste your time and gove you nothing back. Every second of this movie is a plot hole.",A very nice cash grab
eddie_baggins,"In pleasing a result, the third entry into the Fantastic Beasts franchise (a franchise that seemingly exists with support but no dedicated fanbase or huge fanfare) is a marked improvement on the dire misstep that was 2018's The Crimes of Grindelwald, even if Harry Potter veteran director David Yates still can't find the real magic to enliven this wizarding world property to a level that would have it competing in the same space as the beloved films that came before this J. K Rowling property.","Still lacking a certain magic, the newest Fantastic Beasts is a step back in the right direction"
Nagitokomeda,"Where to begin with this agonising experience? Its a 2 hour 20 minute film that feels like its twice that length. I think the writers must have been paid per character they introduce, because this film has so many characters they sink the ship that this franchise is.",Secrets of Dumb-bore
xTkAx,"Here's a short little 154 character review: it was long, boring and uninspiring, lacking what the previous two films had. It's time to sunset the series.",It feels like the series got ruined with this one
paul_haakonsen,"Having recent sat through the two previous movies, I was looking forward to getting to see the third movie in the franchise titled ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"". I must admit that I was having some expectations to writer Steve Kloves and author J. K. Rowling.",The magic fizzled and was replaced by a political drama...
Hayden-86055,"Where do I start, Fantastic Beasts the Secrets of Dumblebore is absolutely terrible. The plot is barebones at best, makes little sense in many places (random portkey, German minister makes speech ""every gets a say"" then let's an animal pick the leader of a country, random exposition scenes just for the sake of it etc) and the acting is average. The music was ok but honestly I enjoyed barely any of this even the action was dull, had no stakes and wasn't exciting.","Really, really awful"
opticus-778-857468,"I watched this at the cinema, I can't say I'm sorry for the money I gave for tickets, but it almost is. First of all I came to watch a fantastic beast movie, the first two parts were great for me so I thought there would be this one too. Well I was wrong, here the emphasis is on interpersonal relationships, politics, the emphasis is on promoting same-sex sexual orientations (in backgrond) and many other smaller and bigger things that have absolutely nothing to do with either genre or story, very few special effects unlike previous works and very few fantastic beast. Well mostly suppress your enthusiasm and don't expect much this movie is an below average timekiller .. blah.","Not good, ðŸ‘Ž"
siderite,"The Harry Potter books achieved so much success because a dedicated writer thought about the story for years and the result, imperfect as it was, became beloved by millions of people as the effort showed. This film is perfect, though, a total and complete mess, written by people who can never come up with more than an elevator pitch and the crave for a big payout. The movie uses a plot that purposefully makes no sense, built on a previous film that no one remembers and manages to cement Dumbledore as a manipulative asshole whose value for humanity is that he looks nice compared to the genocidal maniacs he fights against. But he's gay, so that's fine.",Disappointing to the extreme
guskeller,"The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.",Convoluted
benjaminskylerhill,"It's sometimes funny and often creative, and it's an improvement over its predecessor by default, simply because rather than only 5% of the plot being consequential, about 30% of the plot is consequential.","It puts the ""dumb"" in Dumbledore"
digitalbeachbum,I will say that the visuals were amazing. I thought the cinematography was amazing. However that is where I get off the train.,Brain Rot
sbweightman,"Rather slow and boring with a politically oriented plot which throttles itself through its design choices. There's lots of spectacular looking CGI and special effects, but most of the action was in dark scenes which made it hard to see what was going on and for all the magic in the film, it had none of the awe or amazement of the Harry Potter films. Some funny moments and the acting and music was ok, but the secrets were underwhelming and although the production value was high, the entertainment level was not.","Lacks the magic and awe the series deserves,"
andrewchristianjr,"Though the style part was enjoyable on it's own; the cinematography, special effects, costumes, score, set design and much of the acting was brilliant. It felt great to lose myself into the feel of the wizarding world again. But the plot and the writing felt unanchored in anything real or relatable. Nothing felt earned. Events just happened without much anticipation or appreciation of their significance, and I didn't feel invested much in any of the plot lines or characters. I'm not expert enough to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but I know something did.",NOTHING FELT EARNED.
